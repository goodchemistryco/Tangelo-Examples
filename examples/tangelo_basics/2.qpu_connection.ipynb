    "This notebook elaborates on how the `tangelo.linq` module can facilitate hardware experiments by integrating the API provided by some hardware providers (IonQ, Honeywell...) or broader quantum cloud services providers such as Azure Quantum or Braket. We essentially provide convenience wrappers to these APIs: the API of your favorite cloud provider is still called underneath, using your own credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should be relevant to Tangelo users that prefer to install all the dependencies on their machine, use their own credentials, and be billed directly by the target quantum cloud service(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is an alternative to using [QEMIST Cloud](https://goodchemistry.com/qemist-cloud/), which we intend to make a single and convenient entry point to reach many different platforms. What's pretty cool with this other option is that users do not have to set up the environment required by the quantum cloud(s) of their choice (e.g Braket, Azure Quantum, etc) or even an account with those services. A QEMIST Cloud account provides a single entry point enabling you to reach all of them, and pay with your QEMIST Cloud credits.\n",
