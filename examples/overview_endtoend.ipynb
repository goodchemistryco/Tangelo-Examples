This experiment features an electronic system that could not be realistically solved with a heads-on approach on an existing quantum computer, yet produced great experimental results by combining the DMET problem decomposition technique [[Knizia et al., 2013a](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.186404) and [Knizia et al., 2013b](https://doi.org/10.1021/ct301044e)] with the VQE algorithm [[Kassal et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physchem-032210-103512), [Peruzzo et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5213) and [Cao et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803)] and error-mitigation techniques [[Bharti et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08448)], running on an ion-trap-based quantum processor."

It includes all of the main steps required for quantum chemistry simulation on quantum hardware. In that collaboration, the ring of 10 hydrogen atoms was chosen to demonstrate the viability of Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) as a problem decomposition technique for the purpose of electronic structure calculations. The DMET pipeline enables us to take into account all electrons in the molecule while greatly reducing the amount of computational resources needed.\n",

We provide all the necessary functionalities to obtain `SecondQuantizedMolecule` data and Hamiltonians in order to represent this system adequately from the xyz coordinates. The minimal input for the creation of this object is a nested list of atomic coordinates (a multi-line string can also be thrown at the `SecondQuantizedMolecule` class).\n",

One well-known use case for this is to freeze molecular orbitals with the `frozen_orbitals` argument, in order to reduce problem size, for example."

Note that all the other steps in this pipeline are compatible with other quantum algorithms that can be used for the same purpose (like the phase estimation algorithm).\n",

One important parameter to choose when working with VQE is the choice of strategy to build the parametric wave function (ansatz). At the beginning, we use the vanilla version of a well-known ansatze inspired by the Unitary Coupled Cluster operators in chemistry (a.k.a the UCC ansatze).\n",

Resource estimation helps us assert the feasibility of an approach with regards to device capabilities (simulator or QPU), or compare it to alternatives, including what is considered state-of-the-art.\n",

A more reasonable experiment in the meantime may consist of looking at a single step, and reflect on whether or not this suggests that with more time and resources we could successfully run the whole algorithm on a quantum device, in theory.\n",

Because of the symmetry in our use case, the total energy can be calculated by multiplying the fragment energy by the number of fragments. Thanks to the previous section, we know that we can be critical of these results and compare them to the ones obtained with DMET-VQE with a noiseless simulator, or even the FCI results.\n",

    "Experimental data requires a measure of its uncertainty. As it is often prohibitively expensive to collect large amount of data on quantum computers for the purpose of estimating uncertainty, we generate statistics from our dataset using an established method called bootstrapping [[Efron, B. et al., 1994](https://books.google.ca/books/about/An_Introduction_to_the_Bootstrap.html?id=gLlpIUxRntoC&redir_esc=y)]. For each histogram obtained from our experiment, we resample with replacement from that distribution to generate new histograms of the same sample size. We then use these histograms to calculate a new set of expectation values, RDMs, and total energies. This process is repeated many times, and from those outcomes we calculate the average energy and standard deviation of our experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the one hand, it highlights how problem decomposition can make larger molecular systems amenable to NISQ devices, in combination with pre- and post-processing methods aiming at reducing resource requirements or improving accuracy. Such approaches may play an essential role in applying quantum computers to the study of larger, industrially relevant, chemical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it illustrates the complexity of such experiments and the necessity for the community to keep developing tools that can be articulated together to cover elaborate end-to-end workflows. From a molecule, we have built a quantum computing experiment which involved numerous steps, some related to quantum chemistry algorithms, some tackling the challenges of practical experiments on quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look forward to further developing these tools with the help of the community, in order to both take us a step closer to making quantum computing applicable to real-world problems, but also simply to give you the satisfaction of running a successful experiment yourself soon.\n",
