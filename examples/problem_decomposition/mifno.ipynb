    "## What is MI-FNO ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of increment (MI) expresses the electron correlation energy of a molecular system as a truncated many-body expansion in terms of orbitals, atoms, molecules, or fragments. The electron correlation of the system is expanded in terms of occupied orbitals, and MI is employed to systematically reduce the occupied orbital space. At the same time, the virtual orbital space is reduced based on the frozen natural orbitals (FNO), which are obtained using a one-particle density matrix from second-order, many-body perturbation theory. In this way, a method referred to as the MI-FNO approach is available for the systematic reduction of both the occupied space and the virtual space in quantum chemistry simulations. \n",

    "### 5. Recomputing the total energy of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess the impact of quantum workflows applied to one or several fragments on the total energy of the system, the helper class provides a `mi_summation` method. This class recomputes the total energy of the system, using the reference values obtained classically by QEMIST Cloud, or instead using the values obtained by your quantum workflows for the fragments you specify. This summation was described by the formulas in the first section of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no argument is passed to `mi_summation`, then only reference values are used in the summation, which should then be in agreement (up to machine precision) with `fno_fragments.e_tot`, originally read from the QEMIST Cloud result blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, passing a dictionary using fragment labels as keys and the energy as the corresponding values does the trick. For these fragments, MP2 correction is automatically added, and a new total energy is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between this new total energy and the reference total energy gives you a measure of the accuracy and the impact of combining quantum workflows with classical calculations performed with MI-FNO."

    "\n",
    "This feature allows us to bring together the state-of-the-art MI-FNO problem decomposition schemes available at scale in QEMIST cloud, and quantum workflows written with Tangelo. It facilitates exploring larger, more industrially-relevant use cases with a combination of classical and quantum workflows of your choice, on subproblems that are more ammenable to current devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, this exploration is manual, as we believe the current state of the field does not benefit from a fully automated and streamlined platform... yet! In the future, platforms such as QEMIST Cloud will be able to directly use Tangelo to run entire workflows on cloud infrastructure, using both quantum and classical devices.\n",

    "Maybe your discoveries can contribute to advancing the field, and bring that future a bit sooner. \n",
