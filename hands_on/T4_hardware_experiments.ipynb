    "If you've looked into the documentation, you may have noticed there is more you can do with `Histogram` objects ! In past quantum experiments the Tangelo team has used `post_select`, `remove_qubits`, `resample` and other methods in order to obtain numerical results and compute their statistical uncertainty. We encourage you to further explore !"

    "We simulated calculations on a \"perfect backend\" for the sake of simplicity, but quantum devices are noisy. Before you embark on a quantum experiment, with may be time- and money-consuming, it is good practice to use a noisy simulator to try to anticipate the behavior of the device. This may lead you to change the design of your experiment in order to raise it's rate of success, or keep the cost acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Q:** What if you tried to compute the expectation value for the $H_2$ use case with a backend running with a given amount of shots and a noise model of your choice ? You may be surprised at how much these parameters affect the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Noisy simulation cost is usually linear with the number of shots, which means execution time may increase linearly with it as well."

    "You have reached the end of this hands-on. This should give you a good idea of how to submit tasks to quantum devices using Tangelo, reducing resource requirements, as well as manipulating histograms coming from calculations. Designing successful experiments on current quantum devices can be challenging, as we are under budget constraints and quantum computation is subject to noise. Understanding experimental results and extracting value from them is not always straightforward.\n",
